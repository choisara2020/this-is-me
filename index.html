          <h2>About Sara</h2>
          <p>I have been in the hospitality industry for over 10 years now. I have seen, heard, and been apart of many
            different peoples lives through their stories at the bar. I've learned so much in that field and wanted to be
            able to create an application for Bars and Restaurants that are extremely user friendly. I have noticed there
            are a few programs the industries favors that are a bit outdated. I'm on a mission to update those programs to
            create fluid work shift.</p>

          <p>I can't wait to start my journey and become a software developer and tackle the hospitality industry in a
            different perspective!</p>
